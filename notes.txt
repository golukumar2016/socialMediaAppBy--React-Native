- SafeAreaProvider
- A context provider that wraps your app and enables safe area calculations.
- It ensures that components inside it can access safe area insets (like top notch, bottom home indicator) on iOS and Android.
- You typically wrap your root component with this.

- useSafeAreaInsets(): This hook returns the safe area insets of the device — the space around the screen that shouldn't be obstructed by UI elements (like the notch, status bar, or home indicator).


ActivityIndicator:  it is a built-in React Native component used to show a loading spinner — perfect for indicating that something is in progress, like a network request or a button action.
